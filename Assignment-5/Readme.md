<h1> Part 2: Technical Report </h1>

B.) Briefly share your design research for this assignment.
I gathered my knowledge of the colors and circles during the 60s and had fun with making an aesthetically pleasing work that I could do. I chose the circle-y one that had cool overlaps and pleased my eyes. It was out of the 60's era which contained several rad colors which are my favorites. How did you try to style your "art page" to reflect your exploration of this decade's design trends?

C.) Describe your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.

D.) Summarize your work cycle for this assignment. Review this page if you need some ideas.

E.) Embed a screenshot of your workspace at some point during your development cycle.
