B.) I gathered my knowledge of the colors and circles during the 60s and had fun with making an aesthetically pleasing work that I could do. I chose the circle-y one that had cool overlaps and pleased my eyes. It was out of the 60's era which contained several rad colors which are my favorites. Its style was directly related to the circles and geometric layout that brought the page together.

C.) Orange to blue was a great spectrum to work with as it was complimentary colors.
ccffff, ffd633, 000099, and ffb84d.
