    <h2> Where the Sidewalk Ends
      <h3> By Shel Silverstien
        <hr />

<p>
There is a place where the sidewalk ends
<br /> And before the street begins,
 And there the grass grows soft and white,
<br /> And there the sun burns crimson bright, <br />
And there the moon-bird rests from his flight
<br />To cool in the peppermint wind.

Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
<br /> And the dark street winds and bends.
<br /> Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
<br /> We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
<br />And watch where the chalk-white arrows go
<br />To the place where the sidewalk ends.

Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
<br /> And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,
<br /> For the children, they mark, and the children, they know
<br />The place where the sidewalk ends. </P>
